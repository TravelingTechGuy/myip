MyIP - geolocate by IP
----------------------

This little app shows your external IP and then uses uses the [IPInfoDB API](http://ipinfodb.com/) to provide geolocation data, based on that IP.
Currently, results are offered in JSON format only.

You can test a running version at [http://MyIP.TravelingTechGuy.com](http://myip.travelingtechguy.com/) (hosted on Heroku).

Or, you can check out the Chrome extension that uses the service to show the info in the Chrome browser.
